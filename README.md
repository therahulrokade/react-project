This is final project for MERN training. This project is about, mainting person data in DB with the help of UI. For this purpose I have used ReactJS as a FrontEnd technology and NodeJS as a backend technology for server side programming. For Storage purpose I have used MongoDB non relational database. And for connectivity purpose I have used Express framework. As well as I have implemented JSONtoken based authentication for application.

Also i have implemented react with redux in application.

Note: Need to be install all dependancies. from both frontend and backend root directories run following command. 'npm install' To start server, please run 'npm run start' command from root directory, follow same procedure for Frontend as well.

Thanks and regards,
Rahul
